                    The Company uploads hundreds of invoices manually into a client's portal. 
                    I wrote a script that obtains invoice information from a csv file
                    and python initiates selenium browser driver. The process got automated, 
                    which freed the time for several employees. Currently being used by the finance department.
                    The BOT setup requirement min time setup/mapping. Around 1600 invoices have been 
                    uploaded since August 2021.

                    Created a simple bot that uses an invoice mapping from csv file,
                    and moves invoices from a repository folder
                    to its respective program/project/subproject, 
                    and proper period (YYYY and MM MMM YYYY) folders. If the folder
                    does not exist, the bot creates one, and moves the invoice.

                    Hundreds of invoices are processed monthly, 
                    and each of them requires to be renamed and 
                    its information transposed into excel.
                    With PyPDF2 I was able to create a script which 
                    extracts all the strings from the invoice in PDF format,
                    filters the information using RegEx, and sends them 
                    into an excel spreadsheet. This script helps ease out
                    the data entry portion, as long as the invoice renaming.
                    This script also supports the INVOICE BOT UPLOADER.

                    My curiosity led me to start learning python and 
                    freeCodeCamp was one of my pivot resources into
                    making this happen so far. I often go see my old saved codes
                    and cringe... just how you are cringing from my projects from above right now.
