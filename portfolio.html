                    The company used to upload hundreds of invoices manually into a client's portal. 
                    I wrote a script that obtains invoice information from a csv file
                    and python initiates selenium browser driver, logs into the portal,
                    creates an invoice upload form, fills the form and submits it. 
                    The process got automated (not fully), which freed the time for several employees. 
                    Currently being used by the finance department.
                    The BOT requires minimum setup time and mapping. Around 1600 invoices have been 
                    uploaded since August 2021.

                <p>
                    Created a simple bot that uses an invoice mapping from csv file,
                    and moves invoices from a repository folder
                    into its respective program/project/subproject, 
                    and proper period (YYYY and MM MMM YYYY) directory. If the directory
                    does not exist, the bot creates one, and moves the invoice into the just created directory.

                    Hundreds of invoices are processed monthly, 
                    and each of them requires to be renamed using company's SOP and 
                    its information transposed into excel.
                    With PyPDF2, I was able to create a script which 
                    extracts all the strings from the PDF invoice,
                    filters the information using RegEx, and appends them 
                    into an excel spreadsheet. This script helps ease out
                    the manual data entry portion, as well as the invoice renaming process.
                    This script also supports the INVOICE BOT UPLOADER.

                    My curiosity led me to start learning python and 
                    freeCodeCamp was one of my pivot resources into
                    making this happen so far. I often go see my old saved codes
                    and cringe... just how you are cringing from my projects from above right now.

                    I wanted to learn how to makee an API request, and when I learned 
                    that the ERP system we use at work, Deltek, has the API feature, I wanted to give it a try. 
                    Following the Deltek company API manual online and was able to create
                    GET requests. The API features Vantagepoint
                    provides at the moment is left to be desired due to its limitations on access. 
                    Perhaps it is due to not many users using that feature.... or perhaps my 
                    lack of experience.

                    Most of my time at work I am either dealing with email or using spreadsheets. 
                    I started learning about coding through VBA. This is not a project, but more of
                    a quick reference quick in case I forget, or I cannot find the solution online. 
                    I have saved some of the VBA I use often and think it is very efficient when handling
                    large datasets.
