        <h3>INVOICE UPLOADER</h3>

        <p>Tools: Python (selenium, pandas, pyautogui, PyPDF2, tkinter) </p>
        <p><span>BACKGROUND/PROCEDURE:</span></p>
        <p>
          The company used to upload hundreds of invoices manually into a client's portal.
           This script obtains invoice information from a csv file and python initiates selenium browser driver,
            logs into the portal, creates an invoice upload form, fills the form and submits it. 
            The process got automated (not fully), which freed the time for several employees. 
            Currently being used by the finance department. 
            The BOT requires minimum setup time and mapping. 
            Around 1600 invoices have been uploaded since August 2021.

          <p><span>BACKGROUND/PROCEDURE:</span></p>
          
          <p>
            Created a simple bot that uses an invoice mapping from csv file,
            and moves invoices from a repository folder
            into its respective program/project/subproject, 
            and proper period (YYYY and MM MMM YYYY) directory. If the directory
            does not exist, the bot creates one, and moves the invoice into the just created directory.

          <h3>INVOICE PDF READER</h3>
  
          <p>Tools: Python (pandas, PyPDF2, tkinter) </p>
          
          <p><span>BACKGROUND/PROCEDURE:</span></p>
          
          <p>
            Hundreds of invoices are processed monthly, 
            and each of them requires to be renamed using company's SOP and 
            its information transposed into excel.
            With PyPDF2, the script extracts all the strings from the PDF invoice,
            filters the information using RegEx, and appends them 
            into an excel spreadsheet. This script helps ease out
            the manual data entry portion, as well as the invoice renaming process.
            This script also supports the INVOICE BOT UPLOADER.

            My curiosity led me to start learning python and 
            freeCodeCamp was one of the pivot resources into
            making this happen so far. I often go see my old saved codes
            and cringe... just how you are cringing from my projects from above right now.

          <p>
            Wanted to learn how to make an API request, Deltek, the ERP system used at work, has an API feature, I wanted to give it a try. 
            Following the Deltek company API manual online and was able to create
            GET requests. The API features Vantagepoint
            provides at the moment is left to be desired due to its limitations on access. 
            Perhaps it is due to not many users using that feature.... or perhaps my 
            lack of experience.

          <h3>MY VBA QUICK REFERENCE BOOK</h3>
  
          <p>Tools: VBA</p>
          
          <p><span>BACKGROUND/PROCEDURE:</span></p>
          
          <p>
            Most of my time at work I am either dealing with email or using spreadsheets. 
            I started learning about coding through VBA. This is not a project, but more of
            a quick reference quick in case I forget, or I cannot find the solution online. 
            I have saved some of the VBA I use often and think it is very efficient when handling
            large datasets or repetitive tasks (formatting hell).
