            <p>
                Aspiring software developer, who discovered coding from the boredom of daily spreadsheets.
                I have started my career in public accounting, but my heart was not in accounting pronouncements nor in revenue recognition.
                My heart was in solving daily manual tasks through automation. Working at a bank, I eventually learned VBA (Visual Basic for Application) and 
                Python was the natural progression towards my curiosity.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently watching/following the 100DEVS course on Youtube/Twitch. My plan is to expand my knowledge and learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript,
                and add them into my skillset. My current projects is this portfolio page, along with some daily automation works I do at work during downtime.
                
            </p>

            <p>
                May this about page be something I will cringe years from today. Because this is the best I can do so far...

                I have started my career in public accounting, but my heart was not in accounting pronouncements nor in revenue recognition.
                My heart was in solving daily manual tasks through automation. Working at a bank, I often worked with large datasets with hours of manual procedure.
                I ended learning VBA (Visual Basic for Application) and Python was the natural progression towards my curiosity.
