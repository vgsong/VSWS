      <p>
        I aspire in working in tech. I have discovered coding from the boredom of daily spreadsheets. I started my career in accounting, but realized my heart was not in accounting pronouncements nor in revenue recognition. My heart was in creating things and solving problems through programming/automation. Working at a bank, I eventually taught myself VBA (Visual Basic for Application), and Python was the natural progression towards my curiosity.

      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently watching/following the 100DEVS course on Youtube/Twitch. My plan is to expand my knowledge in HTML/CSS/JavaScript,
        and add them into my skillset. My current projects is this mini-portfolio page, along with some daily automation I do at work during downtime.

        For learning purposes, I did not use bootstrap for this website. Is flex-box cheating?

      </p>


      <p>
      May this about page be something I will cringe years from today. Because this is the best I can do so far...
