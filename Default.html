            <p>
                I aspire in working in tech. I have discovered coding from the boredom of daily spreadsheets. I have started my career in accounting, but realized my heart was not in accounting pronouncements nor in revenue recognition. My heart was in creating things and solving problems through programming/automation. Working at a bank, I eventually taught myself VBA (Visual Basic for Application), and Python was the natural progression towards my curiosity.

            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently watching/following the 100DEVS course on Youtube/Twitch. My plan is to expand my knowledge in HTML/CSS/JavaScript,
                and add them into my skillset. My current projects is this mini-portfolio page, along with some daily automation I do at work during downtime.

            <p>
                For learning purposes, I did not use bootstrap for this website. Is flex-box cheating?

            </p>

            <p>
                May this about page be something I will cringe years from today. Because this is the best I can do so far...
